## Smart Note

This is a sample one page application allowing a user to create his own profile and keep track of his to-dos. For the time being it is necessary to use an anchor word to allow our server to sort and categorize, but once development is in it's final stage, simply entering the activity name itself will be enough.

## Getting Started
1. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
2. Run migrations: `npm run knex migrate:latest`
3. Run the server: `npm run local`
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
